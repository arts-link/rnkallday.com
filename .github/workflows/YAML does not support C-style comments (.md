YAML does not support C-style comments ([](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)). All comments must start with `#`.

2. The rest of your YAML looks mostly correct, but you are mixing v2 and v3 of the actions. It's best to use the latest versions.

**How to fix:**
- Remove the first line with `// filepath: ...`
- Make sure all comments use `#`
- Optionally, update all actions to their latest versions for consistency.

Would you like me to automatically clean up and update your [deploy.yml][def] file for you?
