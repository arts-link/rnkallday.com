# Website Deployment Documentation

## Issue Summary

The GitHub Actions workflow file `deploy.yml` had YAML syntax issues that prevented successful automated deployments:
- C-style comments (`//`) at the beginning of the file, which are not supported in YAML
- Mixture of GitHub Actions v2 and v3 in different steps

## Actions Taken

1. **Attempted to fix the GitHub Actions workflow file**:
   - Multiple attempts were made to fix the syntax of the workflow file by removing the C-style comment and ensuring consistent action versions
   - Due to issues with file modifications, we were unable to successfully update the workflow file

2. **Created manual deployment scripts**:
   - `deploy-simple.sh`: A simple script to build the Hugo site and push to gh-pages branch
   - `deploy-force.sh`: An enhanced version that uses force push to overcome conflicts with the remote branch
   - `deploy.sh`: A copy of the successful deployment script saved for future use

3. **Installed dependencies**:
   - Installed PostCSS and related dependencies that were required for the Hugo build process:
     - postcss
     - postcss-cli
     - autoprefixer
     - tailwindcss

4. **Successfully deployed the website**:
   - Built the site using Hugo
   - Force pushed to the gh-pages branch
   - Added the deployment script to the repository for future use

## Current Status

- The website has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages (last deployment: May 21, 2025)
- A reusable deployment script is now available in the repository as `deploy.sh`
- A troubleshooting log has been created documenting the issues encountered and solutions attempted

## Future Recommendations

1. **Fix GitHub Actions workflow file**:
   - For automated deployments to work, the `deploy.yml` file should be properly fixed
   - Remove the C-style comment at the top
   - Ensure consistent GitHub Actions versions

2. **Regular Manual Deployments**:
   - Until the GitHub Actions workflow is fixed, use the `deploy.sh` script for deployments:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/riankochel/rnkallday.com
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Regular Dependency Updates**:
   - Periodically update npm dependencies to keep them current and secure

## Technical Details

### Hugo Build Process

- Uses Hugo extended version
- Requires PostCSS for CSS processing
- Builds to the `public` directory

### Deployment Process

- Builds the site using Hugo with minification
- Commits the built files to a temporary branch
- Force pushes to the gh-pages branch
- Preserves custom domain configuration (CNAME)
