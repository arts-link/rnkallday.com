# Website Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Session Date: May 21, 2025

## Initial Assessment

During our troubleshooting session, we analyzed the website deployment process and identified several key issues that needed to be addressed:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Issues:**
   - The `deploy.yml` file contained C-style comments (`//`) at the beginning, which are invalid in YAML syntax
   - The file had a mix of GitHub Actions versions (v2 and v3) in different steps
   - Previous attempts to fix these issues were unsuccessful due to file modification problems

2. **Deployment State:**
   - Manual deployment scripts had been created as workarounds (`deploy.sh`, `deploy-force.sh`, `deploy-simple.sh`)
   - The website was successfully deployed to GitHub Pages using manual methods

3. **Repository State:**
   - Several uncommitted changes existed in the repository, including:
     - Modified `DEPLOYMENT-DOCUMENTATION.md`
     - Modified `package-lock.json` and `package.json`
     - Untracked deployment scripts (`deploy-force.sh`, `deploy-simple.sh`)

## Actions Taken

1. **Analyzed the GitHub Actions workflow file (`deploy.yml`)**:
   - Confirmed the presence of the problematic C-style comment
   - Verified that the current workflow file used actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3, and peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3

2. **Validated Hugo build process**:
   - Confirmed Hugo extended version (v0.139.2) was installed and working correctly
   - Successfully built the site with `hugo --gc`
   - No build errors were detected

3. **Examined manual deployment scripts**:
   - `deploy.sh` and `deploy-force.sh` were identical
   - Both use force push to overcome conflicts with the remote branch
   - `deploy-simple.sh` uses a slightly different approach without force pushing

4. **Attempted to fix the GitHub Actions workflow file**:
   - Created a fixed version without the C-style comment
   - Encountered permission issues when trying to replace the original file

5. **Verified the site deployment status**:
   - The Hugo build process completed successfully with 25 pages
   - The site was previously deployed to GitHub Pages

## Pending Actions

1. **Repository Cleanup**:
   - Commit or discard the pending changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - Add the deployment scripts to version control

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Fix**:
   - Options discussed:
     - Create a new workflow file with a different name
     - Convert the manual deployment script into a GitHub Action
     - Fix permissions issues to replace the existing workflow file

3. **Future Maintenance**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Implementing the corrected automated deployment workflow

## Technical Analysis

### Hugo Configuration

- Using Hugo extended version v0.139.2
- PostCSS processing is configured and working
- Dependencies are correctly installed

### Deployment Process

- Current process uses a temporary branch and force push to gh-pages
- CNAME file is preserved during deployment
- The process successfully builds and deploys the site

## Recommendations

1. **Address uncommitted changes** before proceeding with workflow fixes
2. **Standardize on a single deployment script** (the current `deploy.sh` is functioning correctly)
3. **Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file** rather than trying to fix the existing one
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the current deployment process
5. **Consider setting up continuous integration tests** to validate the site builds correctly before deployment

## Next Steps

1. Commit pending changes to the repository
2. Create and test a new GitHub Actions workflow file
3. Update documentation to reflect the current state and process
