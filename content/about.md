## Howdy,I'm Rian.
I tell stories, and I’m damn good at it because I tell them with intent and authenticity. To hell with false modesty.

Everyday I’m bombarded by beautiful stories. A well-crafted collection of words that capture a moment of humanity perfectly. The distant gaze of a stranger who is lost, deep in contemplation about something I can sense is eating them alive. Being witness to (or the instigator of) a random act of kindness. I inevitably stumble across something that shatters my heart into a billion beautiful pieces.

You can find me at the crossroads of tradition and progress, watching the world evolve and dragging the skeptics along for the ride. My work spans across a wide variance - from art and culture to AI  - and it can be found published in places that care about such things.

I’ve washed dishes with ex-convicts, raised millions for the arts, led marketing efforts for tech startups, and learned that the only real job security is curiosity. I don't believe AI can steal your soul, but I'm certain it can make you forget you had one. I write to remind you of this.

I’m that guy with the untamed mohawk and worn-in 501s on your morning train. I’ll also be that guy in a finely tailored tux at the opera tonight. That guy you swear you know from somewhere. And when you blink during your double take, you might just see yourself reflected in my work.
