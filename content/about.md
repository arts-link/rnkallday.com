## Howdy, I’m Rian Kochel. I tell stories, and I’m damn good at it..to hell with false modesty. It’s never done me any favors.

I’ve washed dishes with ex-convicts, raised millions for the arts, led marketing departments for tech startups, and learned that the only real job security is curiosity.

As I drag the skeptics across the intersection of tech and tradition, I don't believe AI can steal your soul, but there's clear evidence it's already convincing people that they don't need one to create compelling art of any discipline. I write to remind the world that words are magic.

I’m that guy with the untamed mohawk and worn-in 501s on your morning train. I’ll also be that guy in a finely tailored tux at the opera tonight. That guy you swear you know from somewhere. And when you blink during your double take, you might just see yourself reflected in my work.
