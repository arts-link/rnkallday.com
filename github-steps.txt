# GitHub Conflict Resolution Steps

Copy and paste these commands one at a time into your terminal:

# Step 1: Make sure you're in the repository directory
cd /Users/riankochel/rnkallday.com

# Step 2: Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Step 3: Switch to the fix branch
git checkout fix/use-theme-scrolling-homepage 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b fix/use-theme-scrolling-homepage origin/fix/use-theme-scrolling-homepage

# Step 4: Merge the main branch into your fix branch
git merge main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them in your editor, then:
# git add .
# git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

# Step 5: Push your changes
git push -u origin fix/use-theme-scrolling-homepage

# Now go back to GitHub and your PR should be updated with resolved conflicts
